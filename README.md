# statistical_data_analysis
This repository contains all the files used for analysis of three different data sets.<br>
The techniques of Fundamentals of *Business statistics, Inferential statistics and Hypothesis testing* are leveraged in this exercise.
The coding language used here is Python Programing.

## DataSet: (.csv)
- Annual spending of wholesale distributor (Wholesale Customers Data.csv).
- Survey of Students News Service at Clear Mountain State University (Survey-1.csv).
- A &amp; B type Asphalt Shinglesâ€™ moisture measurements of manufacturers of ABC Asphalt Shingles (A & B shingles.csv).

## Code File: (.ipynb)
- code_file.ipynb

## Business Report: (.pdf)
- This is a business report that answers certain questions related to each of the dataset facilitating Data based Decisions.  

## Libraries used:
> pandas<br>

> numpy<br>

> seaborn<br>

> matplotlib.pyplot<br>

> scipy.stats<br>

## How to run the code?
- Fork & Clone the repository
- Install the above libraries (virtual environment recommended) if not available using the command `pip install` in terminal
- Open the Code file and run all the cells. (Same Folder hierarchy as in repository to be used)

* This analysis was performed by me as a part of my course work in Post Graduate Program in Data Science & Business Analytics.
